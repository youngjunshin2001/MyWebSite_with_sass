<p>In cell biology, protein kinase A (PKA[N 1]) is a family of enzymes whose activity is dependent on cellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). PKA is also known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Protein kinase A has several functions in the cell, including regulation of glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism.
It should also not be confused with AMP-activated protein kinase – which, although a member of the protein kinase superfamily and a Ser/Thr kinase, may have opposite effects– nor be confused with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), nor be confused with the acid dissociation constant pKa.</p>

   <p><strong><h1>Kinase</h1></strong>
      In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>,  a <strong>kinase</strong> is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme">enzyme</a> that catalyzes the transfer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate">phosphate</a> groups from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_phosphate">high-energy</a>, phosphate-donating molecules to  specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)">substrates</a>. This process is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> when the substrate gains a phosphate group and the high energy molecule of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">ATP</a> donates a phosphate group (producing a  phosphorylated substrate and ADP). On the other side, kinases are also used to  take a phosphate group from a phosphorylated substrate causing ADP to gain a  phosphate group. Conversely, it is referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dephosphorylation">dephosphorylation</a> when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate">ADP</a> gains a phosphate group (producing a  dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP). These two  processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis">glycolysis</a>.  Kinases are part of the larger family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphotransferase">phosphotransferases</a>.  Kinases are not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylase">phosphorylases</a>,  which catalyze the addition of inorganic phosphate groups to an acceptor, nor  with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase">phosphatases</a>, which remove phosphate groups. The  phosphorylation state of a molecule, whether it be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein">protein</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid">lipid</a>,  or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>,  can affect its activity, reactivity, and its ability to bind other molecules.  Therefore, kinases are critical in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signalling">cell  signalling</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_modulation">protein regulation</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_transport">cellular  transport</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway">secretory processes</a>, and countless other  cellular pathways.<br>
  <strong>Biochemistry and functional relevance</strong> <br>
      Kinases mediate the transfer of a phosphate  moiety from a high energy molecule (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">ATP</a>) to their substrate molecule, as seen in  the figure below. Kinases are needed to stabilize this reaction because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoanhydride">phosphoanhydride</a> bond contains a high level of energy. Kinases properly orient their substrate  and the phosphoryl group within in their active sites, which increases the rate  of the reaction. Additionally, they commonly use positively charged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid">amino  acid</a> residues, which electrostatically stabilize the transition  state by interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups.  Alternatively, some kinases utilize bound metal cofactors in their active sites  to coordinate the phosphate groups.<br>
      Kinases are used extensively to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction">transmit signals</a> and regulate complex processes in cells.  Phosphorylation of molecules can enhance or inhibit their activity and modulate  their ability to interact with other molecules. The addition and removal of  phosphoryl groups provides the cell with a means of control because various kinases  can respond to different conditions or signals. Mutations in kinases that lead  to a loss-of-function or gain-of-function can cause cancer<u> </u>and  disease in humans, including certain types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia">leukemia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma">neuroblastomas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma">glioblastoma</a>,<u> </u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia">spinocerebellar ataxia</a> (type 14), forms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agammaglobulinaemia">agammaglobulinaemia</a>, and many others.<br>
  <strong>History and classification</strong> <br>
  <figure><figcaption><img width="488" height="241" src="clip_image002.png" align="left" hspace="12" style="margin-bottom: 2px; margin-right: 12px">This is the caption for Layout Figure Tag</figcaption></figure>The first protein to be recognized as catalyzing the  phosphorylation of another protein using ATP was observed in 1954 by Gene  Kennedy at which time he described a liver enzyme that catalyzed the  phosphorylation of casein. In 1956, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_H._Fischer">Edmond  H. Fischer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_G._Krebs">Edwin G. Krebs</a> discovered that the interconversion  between phosphorylase a and phosphorylase b was mediated by phosophorylation  and dephosphorylation.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase#cite_note-8">[8]</a> The kinase that transferred a phosphoryl group to  Phosphorylase b, converting it to Phosphorylase a, was named Phosphorylase  Kinase. Years later, the first example of a kinase cascade was identified,  whereby Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates Phosphorylase Kinase. At the same  time, it was found that PKA inhibited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_synthase">glycogen  synthase</a>, which was the first example of a phosphorylation event  that resulted in inhibition. In 1969, Lester Reed discovered that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_dehydrogenase">pyruvate dehydrogenase</a> was inactivated by  phosphorylation, and this discovery was the first clue that phosphorylation  might serve as a means of regulation in other metabolic pathways besides <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen">glycogen</a> metabolism. In the same year, Tom Langan discovered that PKA phosphorylates  histone H1, which suggested phosphorylation might regulate nonenzymatic  proteins. The 1970s included the discovery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca2%2B/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase">calmodulin-dependent protein kinases</a> and the  finding that proteins can be phosphorylated on more than one amino acid  residue. The 1990s is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;decade of protein kinase  cascades&rdquo;. During this time, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway">MAPK/ERK  pathway</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase">JAK kinases</a> (a family of protein tyrosine  kinases), and the PIP3-dependent kinase cascade were discovered.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase#cite_note-origins-9">[9]</a></p>
Kinases are classified into broad groups by the substrate they act upon:  protein kinases, lipid kinases, carbohydrate kinases. Kinases can be found in a  variety of species, from bacteria to mold to worms to mammals.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase#cite_note-10">[10]</a> More than five hundred different kinases have been identified in  humans.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase#cite_note-pmid12471243-2">[2]</a> Their diversity and their role in signaling makes them an interesting  object of study. Various other kinases act on small molecules such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid">lipids</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate">carbohydrates</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid">amino  acids</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>, either for signaling or to prime  them for metabolic pathways. Specific kinases are often named after their  substrates. Protein kinases often have multiple substrates, and proteins can  serve as substrates for more than one specific kinase. For this reason protein  kinases are named based on what regulates their activity (i.e.  Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases). Sometimes they are further subdivided  into categories because there are several isoenzymatic forms. For example, type  I and type II cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinases have identical catalytic  subunits but different regulatory subunits that bind cyclic AMP.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase#cite_note-krebs_lec-11">[11]</a>
