     <h1>Ion channel</h1>
     <p><strong>Ion channels</strong> are pore-forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein" title="Membrane protein">membrane proteins</a> that allow ions to pass through  the channel pore. Their functions include establishing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_membrane_potential" title="Resting membrane potential">resting membrane  potential</a>, shaping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" title="Action potential">action potentials</a> and other electrical signals by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)" title="Gating (electrophysiology)">gating</a> the flow of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion" title="Ion">ions</a> across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane" title="Cell membrane">cell membrane</a>, controlling the flow of ions  across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion" title="Secretion">secretory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_cell" title="Epithelial cell">epithelial cells</a>, and regulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a> volume. Ion channels are present in the  membranes of all cells. Ion channels are one of the two classes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionophore" title="Ionophore">ionophoric</a> proteins, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_transporter" title="Ion transporter">ion transporters</a> (including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-potassium_pump" title="Sodium-potassium pump">sodium-potassium pump</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-calcium_exchanger" title="Sodium-calcium exchanger">sodium-calcium  exchanger</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-glucose_transport_proteins" title="Sodium-glucose transport proteins">sodium-glucose  transport proteins</a>). The study of ion channels often involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics" title="Biophysics">biophysics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology" title="Electrophysiology">electrophysiology</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology" title="Pharmacology">pharmacology</a>, while using techniques including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_clamp" title="Voltage clamp">voltage clamp</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_clamp" title="Patch clamp">patch clamp</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry" title="Immunohistochemistry">immunohistochemistry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography" title="X-ray crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy" title="Fluoroscopy">fluoroscopy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT-PCR" title="RT-PCR">RT-PCR</a>. Their classification as molecules is  referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelomics" title="Channelomics">channelomics</a>.</p>

   <h2>1.0 Basic features</h2>
   <p>There are two  distinctive features of ion channels that differentiate them from other types of ion transporter proteins:</p>
     <ol start="1" type="1">
       <li>The rate of ion transport through the channel is very high (often 106 ions per second or greater).</li>
       <li>Ions pass through channels down their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_gradient" title="Electrochemical gradient">electrochemical gradient</a>, which is a function of ion concentration and membrane potential, &quot;downhill&quot;, without the input (or help) of metabolic energy (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-transport" title="Co-transport">co-transport</a> mechanisms, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport" title="Active transport">active transport</a> mechanisms).</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Ion channels  are located within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane" title="Cell membrane">membrane</a> of most  cells and of many intracellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle" title="Organelle">organelles</a>. They are often described as narrow,  water-filled tunnels that allow only ions of a certain size and/or charge to  pass through. This characteristic is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_permeability" title="Selective permeability">selective permeability</a>.  The archetypal channel pore is just one or two atoms wide at its narrowest  point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a>. However, some channels may be  permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a  common charge: positive (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation" title="Cation">cations</a>) or negative (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion" title="Anion">anions</a>).  Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in single file nearly  as quickly as the ions move through free solution. In many ion channels,  passage through the pore is governed by a &quot;gate&quot;, which may be opened  or closed in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or  mechanical force. Ion channels are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_membrane_protein" title="Integral membrane protein">integral membrane  proteins</a>, typically formed as assemblies of several individual  proteins. Such &quot;multi-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit" title="Protein subunit">subunit</a>&quot; assemblies usually involve a  circular arrangement of identical or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)" title="Homology (biology)">homologous</a> proteins  closely packed around a water-filled pore through the plane of the membrane or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer" title="Lipid bilayer">lipid bilayer</a>. For most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel" title="Voltage-gated ion channel">voltage-gated ion  channels</a>, the pore-forming subunit(s) are called the α subunit,  while the auxiliary subunits are denoted β, γ, and so on.</p>
     
     <h2>2.0 Biological role</h2>
     <p>Because  channels underlie the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_impulse" title="Nerve impulse">nerve impulse</a> and  because &quot;transmitter-activated&quot; channels mediate conduction across  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse" title="Synapse">synapses</a>, channels are especially prominent  components of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system" title="Nervous system">nervous system</a>.  Indeed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel#Ion_channel_blockers">numerous toxins</a> that organisms have evolved for  shutting down the nervous systems of predators and prey (e.g., the venoms  produced by spiders, scorpions, snakes, fish, bees, sea snails, and others)  work by modulating ion channel conductance and/or kinetics. In addition, ion  channels are key components in a wide variety of biological processes that  involve rapid changes in cells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle" title="Cardiac muscle">cardiac</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle" title="Skeletal muscle">skeletal</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle" title="Smooth muscle">smooth muscle</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction" title="Muscle contraction">contraction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium" title="Epithelium">epithelial</a> transport of nutrients and ions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-cell" title="T-cell">T-cell</a> activation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas" title="Pancreas">pancreatic</a> beta-cell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin" title="Insulin">insulin</a> release. In the search for new drugs, ion  channels are a frequent target. </p>
     
     <h2>3.0 Diversity</h2>
     <p>There are over  300 types of ion channels just in the cells of the inner ear. Ion channels may be classified by the nature of their  gating, the species of ions passing through those gates, the number of gates  (pores) and localization of proteins.</p>
     <p>Further  heterogeneity of ion channels arises when channels with different constitutive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit" title="Protein subunit">subunits</a> give rise to a specific kind of current.  Absence or mutation of one or more of the contributing types of channel  subunits can result in loss of function and, potentially, underlie neurologic  diseases.</p>
     
     <h3>3.1 Classification by gating</h3>
     <p>Ion channels  may be classified by gating, i.e. what opens and closes the channels. Voltage-gated ion channels open or close depending on the voltage gradient  across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated ion channels open or close  depending on binding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)" title="Ligand (biochemistry)">ligands</a> to  the channel.</p>
     
     <h4>3.1.1 Voltage-gated</h4>
     <p>Voltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential" title="Membrane potential">membrane potential</a>.<img src="img/Action Potential Ion Channels.jpg" alt="GPCRs" width="1027" height="1080" class="img-responsive" style="display: block; margin:auto; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 10px;"></p>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_sodium_channel" title="Voltage-gated sodium channel">Voltage-gated  sodium channels</a>: This family contains at least 9 members and is largely responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" title="Action potential">action potential</a> creation and propagation. The pore-forming α subunits are very large (up to 4,000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>) and  consist of four homologous repeat domains (I-IV) each comprising six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) for a total of 24 transmembrane segments.  The members of this family also coassemble with auxiliary β subunits, each       spanning the membrane once. Both α and β subunits are extensively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation" title="Glycosylation">glycosylated</a>.</li>
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_calcium_channel" title="Voltage-gated calcium channel">Voltage-gated calcium channels</a>: This family contains 10 members, though these members are known to coassemble with α2δ, β, and γ subunits. These channels play an important role in both linking muscle excitation with contraction as well as neuronal excitation with transmitter release. The α subunits have an overall structural resemblance to those of the sodium channels and are equally large. </li>
       <ul type="circle">
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation_channels_of_sperm" title="Cation channels of sperm">Cation channels of sperm</a>: This small family of channels, normally referred to as Catsper channels, is related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-pore_channels" title="Two-pore channels">two-pore channels</a> and distantly related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_response_potential_channel" title="Transient response potential channel">TRP channels</a>.</li>
       </ul>
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_potassium_channel" title="Voltage-gated potassium channel">Voltage-gated potassium channels</a> (KV): This family contains almost 40 members, which are further divided into 12 subfamilies. These channels are known mainly for their role in repolarizing the cell membrane following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" title="Action potential">action potentials</a>. The α subunits have six transmembrane segments, homologous to a single   domain of the sodium channels. Correspondingly, they assemble as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetramer_protein" title="Tetramer protein">tetramers</a> to produce a functioning channel.</li>
       <li>Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel" title="Transient receptor potential channel">transient receptor potential channels</a>: This group of channels, normally referred to simply as TRP channels, is named after their role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila" title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a> phototransduction. This family, containing at least 28 members, is incredibly diverse in its method of activation. Some TRP channels seem to be constitutively open, while others       are gated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel" title="Voltage-gated ion channel">voltage</a>, intracellular Ca2+, pH, redox state, osmolarity, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch-activated_ion_channel" title="Stretch-activated ion channel">mechanical stretch</a>. These channels also vary according to the ion(s) they pass, some being selective for Ca2+ while others are less selective, acting as cation channels. This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: classical (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPC" title="TRPC">TRPC</a>), vanilloid receptors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV" title="TRPV">TRPV</a>), melastatin (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPM" title="TRPM">TRPM</a>), polycystins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPP" title="TRPP">TRPP</a>), mucolipins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPML" title="TRPML">TRPML</a>), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPA_(channel)" title="TRPA (channel)">TRPA</a>).</li>
       <li>Hyperpolarization-activated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_nucleotide-gated_channel" title="Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel">cyclic nucleotide-gated channels</a>: The opening of these channels is due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarization_(biology)" title="Hyperpolarization (biology)">hyperpolarization</a> rather than the depolarization required for other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. These channels are also sensitive to the cyclic nucleotides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate" title="Cyclic adenosine monophosphate">cAMP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate" title="Cyclic guanosine monophosphate">cGMP</a>,       which alter the voltage sensitivity of the channel&rsquo;s opening. These channels are permeable to the monovalent cations K+ and Na+. There are 4 members of this family, all of which form tetramers of six-transmembrane α subunits. As these channels open under hyperpolarizing conditions, they function as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_pacemaker" title="Cardiac pacemaker">pacemaking</a> channels in the heart, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA_node" title="SA node">SA node</a>.</li>
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_proton_channel" title="Voltage-gated proton channel">Voltage-gated proton channels</a>: Voltage-gated proton channels open with depolarization, but in a strongly pH-sensitive manner. The result is that these channels open only when the electrochemical gradient is outward, such that their opening will only allow protons to leave cells. Their function thus appears to be acid extrusion from cells. Another important function occurs in phagocytes (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophils" title="Eosinophils">eosinophils</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophils" title="Neutrophils">neutrophils</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophages" title="Macrophages">macrophages</a>) during the &quot;respiratory burst.&quot; When bacteria or other microbes are engulfed by phagocytes, the enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NADPH_oxidase" title="NADPH oxidase">NADPH oxidase</a> assembles in the membrane and begins to produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species" title="Reactive oxygen species">reactive oxygen species</a> (ROS) that help kill bacteria. NADPH oxidase is       electrogenic, moving electrons across the membrane, and proton channels open to allow proton flux to balance the electron movement electrically.</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>3.1.2 Ligand-gated</h4>
     <p>Also known as ionotropic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)" title="Receptor (biochemistry)">receptors</a>, this group of channels open in response to specific ligand molecules binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor protein. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the structure of the channel protein that ultimately  leads to the opening of the channel gate and subsequent ion flux across the  plasma membrane. Examples of such channels include the cation-permeable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine_receptor" title="Acetylcholine receptor">&quot;nicotinic&quot; Acetylcholine receptor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_receptors" title="Glutamate receptors">ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors</a>, acid sensing ion channels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASICs" title="ASICs">ASICs</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2X_Receptors" title="P2X Receptors">ATP-gated P2X receptors</a>, and the anion-permeable  γ-aminobutyric acid-gated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor" title="GABA receptor">GABA receptor</a>.

     <h3>3.2 Classification by cellular localization</h3>
     <p>Ion channels  are also classified according to their subcellular localization. The plasma  membrane accounts for around 2% of the total membrane in the cell, whereas  intracellular organelles contain 98% of the cell's membrane. The major  intracellular compartments are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum" title="Endoplasmic reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_apparatus" title="Golgi apparatus">Golgi apparatus</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria" title="Mitochondria">mitochondria</a>. On the basis of localization, ion  channels are classified as:</p>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li>Plasma membrane channels </li>
       <ul type="circle">
         <li>Examples: Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv), Sodium channels (Nav), Calcium channels (Cav) and Chloride channels (ClC)</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Intracellular channels, which are further classified into different organelles </li>
       <ul type="circle">
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum" title="Endoplasmic reticulum">Endoplasmic reticulum</a> channels: RyR, SERCA, ORAi</li>
         <li>Mitochondrial channels: mPTP, KATP, BK, IK, CLIC5, Kv7.4 at the inner membrane and VDAC and CLIC4 as outer membrane channels.</li>
       </ul>
     </ul>
     
     <h3>3.3 Other classifications</h3>
     <p>There are other  criteria for ion channel classification, including multiple pores and transient potentials. Almost all ion  channels have a single pore. However, there are also those with two pores:</p>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-pore_channel" title="Two-pore channel">Two-pore channels</a>: This two-member family is thought to form cation-selective ion channels. They appear to contain two KV-style six-transmembrane domains, suggesting that they form a dimer in the membrane. These channels are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation_channels_of_sperm" title="Cation channels of sperm">cation channels of sperm</a> and, more distantly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential" title="Transient receptor potential">TRP</a> channels.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>There are  channels that are classified by the duration of the response to stimuli:</p>
     <ul type="disc">
       <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel" title="Transient receptor potential channel">Transient receptor potential channels</a>: This group of channels, normally referred to simply as TRP channels, is named after their role in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila" title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a></em> visual phototransduction. This family, containing at least 28 members, is diverse in its mechanisms of activation. Some TRP channels remain constitutively open, while others       are gated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel" title="Voltage-gated ion channel">voltage</a>, intracellular Ca2+, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">redox</a> state, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmolarity" title="Osmolarity">osmolarity</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch-activated_ion_channel" title="Stretch-activated ion channel">mechanical stretch</a>. These channels also vary according to the ion(s) they pass, some being selective for Ca2+ while others are less selective       cation channels. This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: canonical TRP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPC" title="TRPC">TRPC</a>), vanilloid receptors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV" title="TRPV">TRPV</a>), melastatin (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPM" title="TRPM">TRPM</a>), polycystins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPP" title="TRPP">TRPP</a>), mucolipins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPML" title="TRPML">TRPML</a>), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPA_(channel)" title="TRPA (channel)">TRPA</a>).</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>4.0 Detailed structure</h2>
     <p>Channels differ  with respect to the ion they let pass (for example, Na+, K+, Cl−), the ways in which they may be  regulated, the number of subunits of which they are composed and other aspects  of structure. Channels belonging to the largest class, which includes the  voltage-gated channels that underlie the nerve impulse, consists of four  subunits with six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_helix" title="Transmembrane helix">transmembrane helices</a> each. On activation, these helices move about and open the pore. Two of these  six helices are separated by a loop that lines the pore and is the primary  determinant of ion selectivity and conductance in this channel class and some  others. The existence and mechanism for ion selectivity was first postulated in  the 1960s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Armstrong" title="Clay Armstrong">Clay Armstrong</a>.  He suggested that the pore lining could  efficiently replace the water molecules that normally shield potassium ions,  but that sodium ions were too small to allow such shielding, and therefore  could not pass through. This mechanism was finally confirmed when the structure  of the channel was elucidated. The channel subunits of one such other class,  for example, consist of just this &quot;P&quot; loop and two transmembrane  helices. The determination of their molecular structure by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderick_MacKinnon" title="Roderick MacKinnon">Roderick MacKinnon</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography" title="Crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> won a share of the 2003 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize in Chemistry">Nobel Prize in  Chemistry</a>. Because of their small size and the difficulty of  crystallizing integral membrane proteins for X-ray analysis, it is only very  recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels  &quot;look like.&quot; Particularly in cases where the crystallography required  removing channels from their membranes with detergent, many researchers regard  images that have been obtained as tentative. An example is the long-awaited  crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel, which was reported in  May 2003. One inevitable ambiguity about these structures relates to the strong  evidence that channels change conformation as they operate (they open and  close, for example), such that the structure in the crystal could represent any  one of these operational states. Most of what researchers have deduced about  channel operation so far they have established through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology" title="Electrophysiology">electrophysiology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry" title="Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">gene</a> sequence comparison and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis" title="Mutagenesis">mutagenesis</a>. Channels can  have single (CLICs) to multiple transmembrane (K channels, P2X receptors, Na  channels) domains which span plasma membrane to form pores. Pore can determine  the selectivity of the channel. Gate can be formed either inside or outside the  pore region.</p>

     <h2>7.0 History</h2>
     <p>The fundamental  properties of currents mediated by ion channels were analyzed by the British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics" title="Biophysics">biophysicists</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hodgkin" title="Alan Hodgkin">Alan Hodgkin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huxley" title="Andrew Huxley">Andrew Huxley</a> as part of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine" title="Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine">Nobel  Prize</a>-winning research on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" title="Action potential">action potential</a>, published in 1952. They built  on the work of other physiologists, such as Cole and Baker's research into voltage-gated membrane pores from 1941. The existence of ion channels was confirmed in the 1970s  by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Katz" title="Bernard Katz">Bernard Katz</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Miledi" title="Ricardo Miledi">Ricardo Miledi</a> using noise analysis. It was then  shown more directly with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology" title="Electrophysiology">electrical recording technique</a> known as the  &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_clamp" title="Patch clamp">patch clamp</a>&quot;, which led to a Nobel Prize to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Neher" title="Erwin Neher">Erwin Neher</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Sakmann" title="Bert Sakmann">Bert Sakmann</a>, the technique's inventors. Hundreds  if not thousands of researchers continue to pursue a more detailed  understanding of how these proteins work. In recent years the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#Planar_patch_clamp" title="Electrophysiology">automated patch clamp devices</a> helped to increase significantly the throughput in ion channel screening. The Nobel Prize  in Chemistry for 2003 was awarded to two American scientists: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderick_MacKinnon" title="Roderick MacKinnon">Roderick MacKinnon</a> for his studies on the physico-chemical properties of ion channel structure and  function, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography" title="X-ray crystallography">x-ray crystallographic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure" title="Protein structure">structure</a> studies, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Agre" title="Peter Agre">Peter Agre</a> for his  similar work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaporin" title="Aquaporin">aquaporins</a>.</p>
