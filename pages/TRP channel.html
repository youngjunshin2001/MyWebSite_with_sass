     <h1>Transient receptor potential  channel</h1>
     <p><strong>Transient  receptor potential channels</strong> (<strong>TRP channels</strong>) are a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel" title="Ion channel">ion channels</a> located mostly on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_membrane" title="Plasma membrane">plasma membrane</a> of numerous animal cell types.  There are about 28 TRP channels that share some structural similarity to each  other. These are grouped into two broad groups: Group 1 includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPC" title="TRPC">TRPC</a> ( &quot;C&quot; for canonical), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV" title="TRPV">TRPV</a> (&quot;V&quot; for  vanilloid), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPM" title="TRPM">TRPM</a> (&quot;M&quot; for melastatin), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPN" title="TRPN">TRPN</a>,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPA_(channel)" title="TRPA (channel)">TRPA</a>. In group 2,  there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPP" title="TRPP">TRPP</a> (&quot;P&quot; for polycystic) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPML" title="TRPML">TRPML</a> (&quot;ML&quot; for mucolipin). Many of these channels mediate a variety of  sensations like the sensations of pain, hotness, warmth or coldness, different  kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are  thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense  hot or cold. Some TRP channels are activated by molecules found in spices like  garlic (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin" title="Allicin">allicin</a>), chilli pepper (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a>), wasabi (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyl_isothiocyanate" title="Allyl isothiocyanate">allyl isothiocyanate</a>);  others are activated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menthol" title="Menthol">menthol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camphor" title="Camphor">camphor</a>, peppermint, and cooling agents; yet  others are activated by molecules found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a> (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC" title="THC">THC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol" title="Cannabidiol">CBD</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol" title="Cannabinol">CBN</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana" title="Stevia rebaudiana">stevia</a>. Some act as sensors of osmotic pressure,  volume, stretch, and vibration. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel" title="Ion channel">ion channels</a> are relatively non-selectively  permeable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation" title="Cation">cations</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium" title="Sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>. TRP channels were initially discovered  in <em>trp</em>-mutant strain of the fruit fly <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila" title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a></em>. Later, TRP channels were found in  vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and  tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane" title="Cell membrane">membrane</a>-spanning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix" title="Helix">helices</a> with intracellular N- and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_terminus" title="C terminus">C-termini</a>. Mammalian TRP  channels are activated and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli and are  expressed throughout the body.</p>

    <h2>1.0 Sub-families</h2>
    <p>They are  encoded by at least 28–30 channel subunit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a> divided into seven sub-families:</p>
    <p>Canonical (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPC" title="TRPC">TRPC</a>) - Associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis" title="Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis">focal  segmental glomerulosclerosis</a>.</p>
    <p>Vanilloid (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV" title="TRPV">TRPV</a>) - TRPV1 mediates the pungent odour and  pain/hot sensations associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperine" title="Piperine">piperine</a>.</p>

    <h2>2.0 Structure</h2>
    <p>Most TRP  channels are composed of 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane" title="Cell membrane">membrane</a>-spanning  helices with intracellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus" title="N-terminus">N-</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_terminus" title="C terminus">C-termini</a>. Mammalian TRP channels are activated  and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli including many post-transcriptional  mechanisms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor" title="G protein-coupled receptor">G-protein receptor  coupling</a>, ligand-gating, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin" title="Ubiquitin">ubiquitination</a>. The receptors are found in almost  all cell types and largely localized in the cell membrane, modulating ion entry.</p>
    
    <h2>3.0 Function</h2>
    <p>TRP channels  modulate ion entry driving forces and Ca2+ and Mg2+ transport machinery in the plasma  membrane, where most of them are located. TRPs have important interactions with  other proteins and often form signaling complexes, the exact pathways of which  are unknown. TRP channels were  initially discovered in the <em>trp</em> mutant strain of the fruit fly <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila" title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a></em>  which displayed transient elevation of  potential in response to light stimuli and were so named <em>transient receptor  potential</em> channels. TRPML channels function as intracellular calcium  release channels and thus serve an important role in organelle regulation.  Importantly, many of these channels mediate a  variety of sensations like the sensations of pain, hotness, warmth or coldness,  different kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels  are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and are used in animals to  sense hot or cold. TRPs act as sensors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure" title="Osmotic pressure">osmotic pressure</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume" title="Volume">volume</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretching" title="Stretching">stretch</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration" title="Vibration">vibration</a>. TRPs have been seen to have complex  multidimensional roles in sensory signaling. Many TRPs function as  intracellular calcium release channels.</p>
    
    <h3>3.1 Pain and temperature sensation</h3>
    <p>TRP ion  channels convert energy into action potentials in somatosensory nociceptors. Thermo-TRP channels have a C-terminal domain that is responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosensation" title="Thermosensation">thermosensation</a> and have a specific  interchangeable region that allows them to sense temperature stimuli that is  tied to ligand regulatory processes. Although most TRP channels are modulated  by changes in temperature, some have a crucial role in temperature sensation.  There are at least 6 different Thermo-TRP channels and each plays a different  role. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPM8" title="TRPM8">TRPM8</a> relates to mechanisms of sensing cold, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPM3" title="TRPM3">TRPM3</a> contribute to heat and inflammation  sensations, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPA1" title="TRPA1">TRPA1</a> facilitates many signaling pathways like  sensory transduction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" title="Nociception">nociception</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress" title="Oxidative stress">oxidative stress</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 Taste</h3>
    <p>TRPM5 is  involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste" title="Taste">taste</a> signaling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet" title="Sweet">sweet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_(taste)" title="Bitter (taste)">bitter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami" title="Umami">umami</a> tastes by modulating the signal pathway in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_receptor" title="Taste receptor">taste receptor</a> cells. The TRP channels play a  significant role in taste with channels responding to different tastes. TRPA1  responds to mustard oil (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyl_isothiocyanate" title="Allyl isothiocyanate">allyl isothiocyanate</a>),  wasabi, and cinnamon, TRPA1 and TRPV responds to garlic (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin" title="Allicin">allicin</a>), TRPV1 responds to chilli pepper (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a>), TRPM8 is activated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menthol" title="Menthol">menthol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camphor" title="Camphor">camphor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppermint" title="Peppermint">peppermint</a>, and cooling agents; TRPV2 is  activated by molecules (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC" title="THC">THC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol" title="Cannabidiol">CBD</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol" title="Cannabinol">CBN</a>) found in marijuana; TRPM5 is activated by  the sweet glycosides found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana" title="Stevia rebaudiana">stevia</a> plant.</p>
    
    <h2>4.0 TRP-like channels in insect vision</h2>
    <p>Figure 1. Light-activated TRPL channels in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplaneta_americana" title="Periplaneta americana">Periplaneta americana</a> photoreceptors. A, a typical current through TRPL channels was evoked by a 4-s  pulse of bright light (horizontal bar). B, a photoreceptor membrane voltage  response to the light-induced activation of TRPL channels, data from the same  cell are shown. The <em>trp</em>-mutant  fruit flies, which lack a functional copy of trp gene, are characterized by a  transient response to light, unlike wild-type flies that demonstrate a  sustained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell" title="Photoreceptor cell">photoreceptor cell</a> activity in response to light. A distantly related isoform of TRP channel,  TRP-like channel (TRPL), was later identified in <em>Drosophila</em> photoreceptors, where it is expressed at approximately 10- to 20-fold lower  levels than TRP protein. A mutant fly, <em>trpl</em>, was subsequently isolated.  Apart from structural differences, the TRP and TRPL channels differ in cation  permeability and pharmacological properties. TRP/TRPL  channels are solely responsible for depolarization of insect photoreceptor  plasma membrane in response to light. When these channels open, they allow  sodium and calcium to enter the cell down the concentration gradient, which  depolarizes the membrane. Variations in light intensity affect the total number  of open TRP/TRPL channels, and, therefore, the degree of membrane  depolarization. These graded voltage responses propagate to photoreceptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse" title="Synapse">synapses</a> with second-order retinal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron" title="Neuron">neurons</a> and further to the brain. It is important  to note that the mechanism of insect photoreception is dramatically different  from that in mammals. Excitation of rhodopsin in mammalian photoreceptors leads  to the hyperpolarization of the receptor membrane but not to depolarization as  in the insect eye. In <em>Drosophila</em> and, it is presumed, other insects, a  phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated signaling cascade links photoexcitation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin" title="Rhodopsin">rhodopsin</a> to the opening of the TRP/TRPL  channels. Although numerous activators of these channels such as  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and polyunsaturated fatty acids  (PUFAs) were known for years, a key factor mediating chemical coupling between  PLC and TRP/TRPL channels remained a mystery until recently. It was found that  breakdown of a lipid product of PLC cascade, diacylglycerol (DAG), by the  enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacylglycerol_lipase" title="Diacylglycerol lipase">Diacylglycerol lipase</a>,  generates PUFAs that can activate TRP channels, thus initiating membrane  depolarization in response to light. This mechanism of TRP channel activation  may be well-preserved among other cell types where these channels perform  various functions.</p>
    
    <h2>5.0 Clinical significance</h2>
    <p>Mutations in  TRPs have been linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration" title="Neurodegeneration">neurodegenerative</a> disorders, skeletal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia" title="Dysplasia">dysplasia</a>, kidney disorders, and may play an  important role in cancer. TRPs may make important therapeutic targets. There is  significant clinical significance to TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3 and TRPM8&rsquo;s role as  thermoreceptors, and TRPV4 and TRPA1&rsquo;s role as mechanoreceptors; reduction of  chronic pain may be possible by targeting ion channels involved in thermal,  chemical, and mechanical sensation to reduce their sensitivity to stimuli. For  instance the use of TRPV1 agonists would potentially inhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" title="Nociception">nociception</a> at TRPV1, particularly in pancreatic  tissue where TRPV1 is highly expressed. The TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, found in  chili peppers, has been indicated to relieve neuropathic pain.  TRPV1 agonists inhibit nociception at TRPV1</p>
    
    <h3>5.1 Role in cancer</h3>
    <p>Altered  expression of TRP proteins often leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumorigenesis" title="Tumorigenesis">tumorigenesis</a>, clearly seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPM" title="TRPM">TRPM</a>1  and TRPV6.  Particularly high levels of  TRPM1 and TRPV6 in prostate cancer and of TRPM1 in melanomas have been noted.  Such observations could be helpful in following cancer progression and could  lead to the development of drugs over activating ion channels, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis" title="Necrosis">necrosis</a>. Much research remains to be done as to  whether TRP channel mutations lead to cancer progression or whether they are  associated mutations.</p>
    
    <h2>6.0 History of Drosophila TRP channels</h2>
    <p>The original  TRP-mutant in <em>Drosophila</em> was first described by Cosens and Manning in  1969 as &quot;a mutant strain of <em>D. melanogaster</em> which, though behaving  phototactically positive in a T-maze under low ambient light, is visually  impaired and behaves as though blind&quot;. It also showed an abnormal ERG  response to light and it was  investigated subsequently by Baruch Minke, a post-doc in the group of William  Pak, and named TRP according to its behavior in the ERG. The identity of the  mutated protein was unknown until it was cloned by Craig Montell, a post-doctoral researcher in Gerald Rubin's research group, in 1989, who noted  its predicted structural relationship to channels known at the time and Roger  Hardie and Baruch Minke who provided evidence in 1992 that it is an ion channel  that opens in response to light stimulation. The TRPL channel was cloned and  characterized in 1992 by the research group of Leonard Kelly.</p>

    <h2>8.0 TRPA1</h2>
    <p>Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1, also known as transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 or TRPA1, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> that in humans is encoded by the <em>TRPA1</em> (and in other species by the <em>Trpa1</em>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">gene</a>. TRPA1 is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel" title="Ion channel">ion channel</a> located on the plasma membrane of many human and animal cells. This ion channel  is best known as a sensor for environmental irritants giving rise to  somatosensory modalities such as pain, cold and itch. </p>
    
    <h3>8.1 Function</h3>
    <p>TRPA1 is a  member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel" title="Transient receptor potential channel">transient receptor potential channel</a> family. TRPA1 contains 14 N-terminal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankyrin" title="Ankyrin">ankyrin</a> repeats and is believed to function as a mechanical and chemical stress sensor.  The specific function of this protein has not yet been determined; however,  studies indicate that the function may involve a role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction" title="Signal transduction">signal transduction</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth" title="Cell growth">growth</a> control. Recent studies  indicate that TRPA1 is activated by a number of reactive  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyl_isothiocyanate" title="Allyl isothiocyanate">allyl isothiocyanate</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamaldehyde" title="Cinnamaldehyde">cinnamaldehyde</a>,  farnesyl thiosalicylic acid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalin" title="Formalin">formalin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide" title="Hydrogen peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-hydroxynonenal" title="4-hydroxynonenal">4-hydroxynonenal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrolein" title="Acrolein">acrolein</a>,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas" title="Tear gas">tear gases</a>)  and non-reactive compounds (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine" title="Nicotine">nicotine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF-4840154" title="PF-4840154">PF-4840154</a>) and considered as a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor" title="Chemoreceptor">chemosensor</a>&quot;  in the body. TRPA1 is considered as an attractive pain target based on the fact  that TRPA1 knockout mice showed near complete attenuation of formalin-induced  pain behaviors. TRPA1 antagonists are effective in blocking pain behaviors  induced by inflammation (complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freund%27s_adjuvant" title="Freund's adjuvant">Freund's adjuvant</a> and formalin). Although it is  not firmly confirmed whether noxious cold sensation is mediated by TRPA1 in  vivo, several recent studies clearly demonstrated cold activation of TRPA1  channels in vitro. In the  heat-sensitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreal_pit" title="Loreal pit">Loreal pit</a> organs of many snakes TRPA1 is responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes" title="Infrared sensing in snakes">detection of infrared radiation</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>8.2 Clinical significance</h3>
    <p>In 2008, it was  observed that caffeine suppresses activity of human TRPA1, but it was found  that mouse TRPA1 channels expressed in sensory neurons cause an aversion to  drinking caffeine-containing water, suggesting that the TRPA1 channels mediate  the perception of caffeine. TRPA1 has also  been implicated in causing the skin irritation experienced by some smokers  trying to quit by using nicotine replacement therapies such as inhalers,  sprays, or patches. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation" title="Missense mutation">missense mutation</a> of TRPA1 was found to be the  cause of a hereditary episodic pain syndrome. A family from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> suffers from &quot;debilitating upper-body pain starting in infancy&quot; that  is &quot;usually triggered by fasting or fatigue (illness, cold temperature,  and physical exertion being contributory factors)&quot;. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function" title="Gain-of-function">gain-of-function</a> mutation in the fourth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_domain" title="Transmembrane domain">transmembrane domain</a> causes the channel to be  overly sensitive to pharmacological activation. Metabolites of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) have been demonstrated to bind to the TRPA1 receptors (probably  agonism which then can lead to desensitization of TRPA1 receptors in the way  that capsaicin does it [-&gt; see capsaicin]) in the spinal cord of mice, causing  an antinociceptive effect. This is suggested as the antinociceptive mechanism  for paracetamol. Oxalate, a  metabolite of an anti-cancer drug oxaliplatin, has been demonstrated to inhibit  prolyl hydroxylase, which endows cold-insensitive human TRPA1 with pseudo cold  sensitivity (via reactive oxygen generation from mitochondria). This may cause  a characteristic side-effect of oxaliplatin (cold-triggered acute peripheral  neuropathy). </p>
    
    <h3>8.3 Ligand binding</h3>
    <p>TRPA1 can be  considered to be one of the most promiscuous TRP ion channels, as it seems to  be activated by a large number of noxious chemicals found in many plants, food,  cosmetics and pollutants. Activation of  the TRPA1 ion channel by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_phenol" title="Natural phenol">phenolic</a> compound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleocanthal" title="Oleocanthal">oleocanthal</a> appears to be responsible for the pungent or &quot;peppery&quot; sensation in  the back of the throat caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a>. Although  several nonelectrophilic agents such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymol" title="Thymol">thymol</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menthol" title="Menthol">menthol</a> have been reported as TRPA1 agonists, most of the known activators are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophilic" title="Electrophilic">electrophilic</a> chemicals that have been shown to activate the TRPA1 receptor via the formation  of a reversible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent" title="Covalent">covalent</a> bond with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine" title="Cysteine">cysteine</a> residues present in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel" title="Ion channel">ion channel</a>. For a broad range of electrophilic agents,  chemical reactivity in combination with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilicity" title="Lipophilicity">lipophilicity</a> enabling membrane permeation is crucial to TRPA1 agonistic effect. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_gas" title="CR gas">dibenz[<em>b,f</em>][1,4]oxazepine</a> derivative substituted by a carboxylic methylester at position 10 is the most  potent TRPA1 agonist discovered to date (EC50 = 50 pM). The pyrimidine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF-4840154" title="PF-4840154">PF-4840154</a> is a potent, non-covalent activator of both the human (EC50 = 23 nM) and rat (EC50 = 97 nM) TrpA1 channels. This compound  elicits nociception in a mouse model through TrpA1 activation. Furthermore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF-4840154" title="PF-4840154">PF-4840154</a> is superior to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyl_isothiocyanate" title="Allyl isothiocyanate">allyl isothiocyanate</a>, the pungent component of  mustard oil, for screening purposes. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoids" title="Eicosanoids">eicosanoids</a> formed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOX12" title="ALOX12">ALOX12</a> (i.e. arachidonate-12-lipoxygnease) pathway of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid_metabolism" title="Arachidonic acid metabolism">arachidonic acid metabolism</a>, 12<em>S</em>-hydroperoxy-5<em>Z</em>,8<em>Z</em>,10<em>E</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatetraenoic  acid (i.e. 12<em>S</em>-HpETE; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic_acid" title="12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid">12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid</a>) and the  hepoxilins (Hx), HxA3 (i.e. 8<em>R/S</em>-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5<em>Z</em>,9<em>E</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatrienoic  acid) and HxB3 (i.e. 10<em>R/S</em>-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5<em>Z</em>,8<em>Z</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatrienoic  acid) (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepoxilin#Pain_perception" title="Hepoxilin">Hepoxilin-Pain perception</a>) directly activate TRPA1 and thereby  contribute to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia" title="Hyperalgesia">hyperalgesia</a> and tactile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allodynia" title="Allodynia">allodynia</a> responses of mice to skin inflammation. In this animal model of pain  perception, the hepoxilins are released in spinal cord and directly activate  TRPA (and also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a>)  receptors to augment the perception of pain. 12<em>S</em>-HpETE, which is the direct  precursor to HxA3 and HxB3 in the ALOX12 pathway, may act only after being  converted to these hepoxilins. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxide" title="Epoxide">epoxide</a>,  4,5-epoxy-8<em>Z</em>,11<em>Z</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatrienoic acid (4,5-EET) made by  the metabolism of arachidonic acid by any one of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450" title="Cytochrome P450">cytochrome P450</a> enzymes (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxyeicosatrienoic_acid" title="Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid">Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid</a>) likewise directly  activates TRPA1 to amplify pain perception. Studies with  mice, guinea pig, and human tissues and in guinea pigs indicate that another  arachidonic acid metabolite, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2" title="Prostaglandin E2">Prostaglandin E2</a>,  operates through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_EP3_receptor" title="Prostaglandin EP3 receptor">prostaglandin EP3</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein_coupled_receptor" title="G protein coupled receptor">G protein coupled receptor</a> to trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough" title="Cough">cough</a> responses. Its  mechanism of action does not appear to involve direct binding to TRPA1 but  rather the indirect activation and/or sensitization of TRPA1 as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a> receptors. Genetic  polymorphism in the EP3 receptor (rs11209716), has been associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor#adverse_effects_cough" title="ACE inhibitor">ACE inhibitor</a>-induce cough in humans. </p>
    
    <h3>8.4 TRPA1 inhibition</h3>
    <p>Resolvin D1 (RvD1) and RvD2 (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvins" title="Resolvins">resolvinss</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maresin" title="Maresin">maresin</a> 1 are metabolites of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_3_fatty_acid" title="Omega 3 fatty acid">omega 3 fatty acid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid" title="Docosahexaenoic acid">docosahexaenoic acid</a>.

These SPMs also  dampen pain perception arising from various inflammation-based causes in animal  models. The mechanism behind their pain-dampening effect involves the  inhibition of TRPA1, probably (in at least certain cases) by an indirect effect  wherein they activate another receptor located on neurons or nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia" title="Microglia">microglia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte" title="Astrocyte">astrocytes</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMKLR1" title="CMKLR1">CMKLR1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPR32" title="GPR32">GPR32</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPR2" title="FPR2">FPR2</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor" title="NMDA receptor">NMDA receptors</a> have been proposed to be the receptors through which SPMs may operate to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down-regulate" title="Down-regulate">down-regulate</a> TRPs and thereby pain perception. </p>

	<h2>9.0 TRPV1</h2>
    <p>The <strong>transient  receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1</strong> <strong>(TrpV1)</strong>, also  known as the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> receptor</strong> and the <strong>vanilloid receptor 1</strong>, is  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> that, in humans, is encoded by the <em>TRPV1</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">gene</a>. It was the first  isolated member of the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor proteins  that in turn are a sub-family of the transient receptor potential protein  group. This protein is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV" title="TRPV">TRPV</a> group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel" title="Transient receptor potential channel">transient receptor potential</a> family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel" title="Ion channel">ion channels</a>. The function of TRPV1 is detection and regulation  of body temperature. In addition, TRPV1 provides a sensation of scalding heat  and pain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" title="Nociception">nociception</a>).</p>
    
    <h3>9.1 Function</h3>
    <p>TRPV1 is a  nonselective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation" title="Cation">cation</a> channel that may be activated by a wide variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous" title="Exogenous">exogenous</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous" title="Endogenous">endogenous</a> physical and chemical stimuli. The best-known activators of TRPV1 are:  temperature greater than 43 °C (109 °F); acidic conditions; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a>,  the irritating compound in hot chili peppers; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyl_isothiocyanate" title="Allyl isothiocyanate">allyl isothiocyanate</a>, the pungent compound in  mustard and wasabi. The activation of TRPV1 leads to a painful, burning  sensation. Its endogenous activators include: low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> (acidic conditions),  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid" title="Endocannabinoid">endocannabinoid</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide" title="Anandamide">anandamide</a>,  N-oleyl-dopamine, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-arachidonoyl-dopamine" title="N-arachidonoyl-dopamine">N-arachidonoyl-dopamine</a>. TRPV1 receptors are  found mainly in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptive" title="Nociceptive">nociceptive</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons" title="Neurons">neurons</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system" title="Peripheral nervous system">peripheral nervous system</a>, but they have also  been described in many other tissues, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">central nervous system</a>. TRPV1 is involved in  the transmission and modulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" title="Nociception">nociception</a>),  as well as the integration of diverse painful stimuli. </p>
    
    <h3>9.2 Sensitization</h3>
    <p>The sensitivity  of TRPV1 to noxious stimuli, such as high temperatures, is not static. Upon  tissue damage and the consequent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a>,  a number of inflammatory mediators, such as various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandins" title="Prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinin" title="Bradykinin">bradykinin</a>,  are released. These agents increase the sensitivity of nociceptors to noxious  stimuli. This manifests as an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia" title="Hyperalgesia">hyperalgesia</a>)  or pain sensation in response to non-painful stimuli (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allodynia" title="Allodynia">allodynia</a>).  Most sensitizing pro-inflammatory agents activate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C" title="Phospholipase C">phospholipase C</a> pathway. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C" title="Protein kinase C">protein kinase C</a> have been shown to play a role in sensitization of TRPV1. The cleavage of PIP2  by PLC-beta can result in disinhibition of TRPV1 and, as a consequence,  contribute to the sensitivity of TRPV1 to noxious stimuli.</p>
    
    <h3>9.3 Desensitization</h3>
    <p>Upon prolonged  exposure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a>,  TRPV1 activity decreases, a phenomenon called <em>desensitization</em>.  Extracellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> ions are required for this phenomenon, thus influx of calcium and the  consequential increase of intracellular calcium mediate this effect. Various  signaling pathways such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmodulin" title="Calmodulin">calmodulin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin" title="Calcineurin">calcineurin</a>,  and the decrease of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIP2" title="PIP2">PIP2</a>,  have been implicated in desensitization of TRPV1. Desensitization of TRPV1 is  thought to underlie the paradoxical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic" title="Analgesic">analgesic</a> effect of capsaicin.</p>
    
    <h3>9.4 Clinical significance in peripheral nervous system</h3>
    <p>Treatment of  pain is an unmet medical need costing billions of dollars every year. As a  result of its involvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" title="Nociception">nociception</a>, TRPV1 has been a prime target for the development  of novel pain reducers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesics" title="Analgesics">analgesics</a>). Two major strategies have been used:</p>
    
    <h3>9.5 Antagonists</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" title="Receptor antagonist">Antagonists</a> block TRPV1 activity, thus reducing  pain. Identified antagonists include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist#Competitive" title="Receptor antagonist">competitive</a> antagonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsazepine" title="Capsazepine">capsazepine</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist#Non-competitive" title="Receptor antagonist">non-competitive</a> antagonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenium_red" title="Ruthenium red">ruthenium red</a>.  These agents could be useful when applied systemically. Numerous TRPV1  antagonists have been developed by pharmaceutical companies. TRPV1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" title="Receptor antagonist">antagonists</a> have shown efficacy in reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" title="Nociception">nociception</a> from inflammatory and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain" title="Neuropathic pain">neuropathic pain</a> models in rats. This provides  evidence that TRPV1 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a>'s sole receptor. In humans, drugs acting at TRPV1  receptors could be used to treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic" title="Neuropathic">neuropathic</a> pain associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis" title="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy" title="Chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>,  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation" title="Amputation">amputation</a>,  as well as pain associated with the inflammatory response of damaged tissue,  such as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis" title="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a>. The major roadblock for the usefulness of  these drugs is their effect on body temperature (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia" title="Hyperthermia">hyperthermia</a>).  The role of TRPV1 in the regulation of body temperature has emerged in the last  few years. Based on a number of TRPV-selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" title="Receptor antagonist">antagonists</a>' causing an increase in body  temperature (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia" title="Hyperthermia">hyperthermia</a>), it was proposed that TRPV1 is tonically active  in vivo and regulates body temperature by telling the body to &quot;cool itself  down&quot;. Without these signals, the body overheats. Likewise, this explains  the propensity of capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) to cause sweating (i.e.: a signal  to reduce body temperature). In a recent report, it was found that tonically  active TRPV1 channels are present in the viscera and keep an ongoing suppressive  effect on body temperature. Recently, it was proposed that predominant function  of TRPV1 is body temperature maintenance.  Experiments have shown that TRPV1 blockade  increases body temperature in multiple species, including rodents and humans,  suggesting that TRPV1 is involved in body temperature maintenance. Recently,  AMG 517, a highly selective TRPV1 antagonist was dropped out of clinical trials  due to the undesirable level of hyperthermia. A second molecule, SB-705498, was  also evaluated in the clinic but its effect on body temperature was not  reported. Recently, it was disclosed that clinical trials of two more TRPV1  antagonists, GRC 6211 and NGD 8243, have been stopped. Post translational  modification of TRPV1 protein by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> is critical for its functionality. Recent reports published from NIH suggest  that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 is required for its ligand-induced  channel opening. </p>
    
    <h3>9.6 Agonists</h3>
    <p>TRPV1 is  activated by numerous agonists from natural sources. Agonists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resiniferatoxin" title="Resiniferatoxin">resiniferatoxin</a> activate TRPV1 and, upon prolonged  application, cause TRPV1 activity to decrease (desensitization), leading to  alleviation of pain via the subsequent decrease in the TRPV1 mediated release  of inflammatory molecules following exposures to noxious stimuli. Agonists can  be applied locally to the painful area in various forms, generally as a patch  or an ointment. Numerous capsaicin-containing creams are available over the  counter, containing low concentrations of capsaicin (0.025 - 0.075%). It is  debated whether these preparations actually lead to TRPV1 desensitization; it  is possible that they act via counter-irritation. Novel preparations containing  higher capsaicin concentration (up to 10%) are under clinical trials. 8%  capsaicin patches have recently become available for clinical use, with  supporting evidence demonstrating that a 30-minute treatment can provide up to  3 months analgesia by causing regression of TRPV1-containing neurons in the  skin. Currently, these treatments must be re-administered on a regular (albeit  infrequent) schedule in order to maintain their analgesic effects.</p>
    
    <h3>9.7 Fatty acid metabolites</h3>
    <p>Certain  metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to stimulate cells  in a TRPV1-dependent fashion. The metabolites of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid" title="Linoleic acid">linoleic acid</a>,  including 13(<em>S</em>)-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE), 13(<em>R</em>)-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic  acid (13(<em>R</em>)-HODE, 9(<em>S</em>)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid  (9(<em>S</em>)-HODE), 9(<em>R</em>)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(<em>R</em>)-HODE),  and their respective keto analogs, 13-oxoODE and 9-oxoODE (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13-HODE" title="13-HODE">13-HODE</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-HODE" title="9-HODE">9-HODE</a> sections  on Direct actions), activate peripheral and central mouse pain sensing neurons.  Reports disagree on the potencies of these metabolites with, for example, the  most potent one, 9(<em>S</em>)-HODE, requiring at least 10 micromoles/liter. or a  more physiological concentration of 10 nanomoles/liter to activate TRPV1 in rodent neurons.  The TRPV1-dependency of these metabolites' activities appears to reflect their  direct interaction with TPRV1. Although relatively weak agonists of TRPV1 in  comparison to anandamide, these linoleate metabolites have been proposed to act  through TRPV1 in mediating pain perception in rodents and to cause injury to  airway epithelial cells and thereby to contribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> disease in mice and therefore possibly humans. Certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid" title="Arachidonic acid">arachidonic acid</a> metabolites, including 20-hydroxy-5<em>Z</em>,8<em>Z</em>,11<em>Z</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatetraenoic  acid (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic_acid" title="20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid">20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid</a>) and 12(<em>S</em>)-hydroperoxy-5<em>Z</em>,8<em>Z</em>,10<em>E</em>,12<em>S</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatetraenoic  acid (12(S)-HpETE), 12(<em>S</em>)-hydroxy-5<em>Z</em>,8<em>Z</em>,10<em>E</em>,12<em>S</em>,14<em>Z</em>-eicosatetraenoic  acid (12(<em>S</em>)-HETE (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-HETE" title="12-HETE">12-HETE</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepoxilin" title="Hepoxilin">hepoxilin</a> A3 (i.e. 8R/S-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5Z,9E,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid) and HxB3 (i.e.  10R/S-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5Z,8Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid) likewise activate  TRPV1 and may thereby contribute to tactile hyperalgesia and allodynia (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepoxilin#Pain_perception" title="Hepoxilin">Hepoxilin-Pain  perception</a>). Studies with mice, guinea pig, and human tissues and in  guinea pigs indicate that another arachidonic acid metabolite, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2" title="Prostaglandin E2">Prostaglandin E2</a>,  operates through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_EP3_receptor" title="Prostaglandin EP3 receptor">prostaglandin EP3</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein_coupled_receptor" title="G protein coupled receptor">G protein coupled receptor</a> to trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough" title="Cough">cough</a> responses. Its  mechanism of action involves activation and/or sensitization of TRPV1 (as well  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPA1" title="TRPA1">TRPA1</a>)  receptors, presumably by an indirect mechanism. Genetic polymorphism in the EP3  receptor (rs11209716), has been associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor#adverse_effects_cough" title="ACE inhibitor">ACE inhibitor</a>-induced cough in humans. Resolvin E1 (RvE1),  RvD2 (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvin" title="Resolvin">resolvins</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotectin_D1" title="Neuroprotectin D1">neuroprotectin D1</a> (NPD1), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maresin" title="Maresin">maresin</a> 1 (Mar1) are metabolites of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_3_fatty_acid" title="Omega 3 fatty acid">omega 3 fatty acids</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid" title="Eicosapentaenoic acid">eicosapentaenoic acid</a> (for RvE1) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid" title="Docosahexaenoic acid">docosahexaenoic acid</a> (for RvD2, NPD1, and  Mar1). These metabolites are members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_proresolving_mediators" title="Specialized proresolving mediators">specialized proresolving mediators</a> (SPMs)  class of metabolites that function to resolve diverse inflammatory reactions  and diseases in animal models and, it its proposed, humans. These SPMs also  dampen pain perception arising from various inflammation-based causes in animal  models. The mechanism behind their pain-dampening effects involves the  inhibition of TRPV1, probably (in at least certain cases) by an indirect effect  wherein they activate other receptors located on the neruons or nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia" title="Microglia">microglia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte" title="Astrocyte">astrocytes</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMKLR1" title="CMKLR1">CMKLR1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPR32" title="GPR32">GPR32</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPR2" title="FPR2">FPR2</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor" title="NMDA receptor">NMDA receptors</a> have been proposed to be the receptors through which these SPMs operate to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down-regulate" title="Down-regulate">down-regulate</a> TRPV1 and thereby pain perception. </p>
    
    <h3>9.9 Fatty acid conjugates</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Arachidonoyl_dopamine" title="N-Arachidonoyl dopamine">N-Arachidonoyl dopamine</a>, a endocannabinoid  found in the human CNS, structurally similar to capsaicin, activates the TRPV1  channel with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC50" title="EC50">EC50</a> of approximately of 50 nM. N-Oleyl-dopamine, another endogenous agonist, binds  bind to human VR1 with an Ki of 36 Nm. Another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid" title="Endocannabinoid">endocannabinoid</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide" title="Anandamide">anandamide</a> has also been shown to act on TRPV1 receptors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM404" title="AM404">AM404</a>—an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_metabolite" title="Active metabolite">active metabolite</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a>—that  serves as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide" title="Anandamide">anandamide</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor" title="Reuptake inhibitor">reuptake inhibitor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX" title="COX">COX</a> inhibitor also serves  as a potent TRPV1 agonist. The plant-biosynthesized cannabinoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol" title="Cannabidiol">cannabidiol</a> also shows &quot;either direct or indirect activation&quot; of TRPV1 receptors. </p>
    
    <h3>9.10 Central nervous system</h3>
    <p>TRPV1 is also  expressed at high levels in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">central nervous system</a> and has been proposed as  a target for treatment not only of pain but also for other conditions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>.  Furthermore, TRPV1 appears to mediate long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus" title="Hippocampus">hippocampus</a>.  LTD has been linked to a decrease in the ability to make new memories, unlike  its opposite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation" title="Long-term potentiation">long-term potentiation</a> (LTP), which aids in  memory formation. A dynamic pattern of LTD and LTP occurring at many synapses  provides a code for memory formation. Long-term depression and subsequent  pruning of synapses with reduced activity is an important aspect of memory  formation. In rat brain slices, activation of TRPV1 with heat or capsaicin  induced LTD while capsazepine blocked capsaicin's ability to induce LTD. In the  brainstem (solitary tract nucleus), TRPV1 controls the asynchronous and  spontaneous release of glutamate from unmyelinated cranial visceral afferents -  release processes that are active at normal temperatures and hence quite  distinct from TRPV1 responses in painful heat. Hence, there may be therapeutic  potential in modulating TRPV1 in the central nervous system, perhaps as a  treatment for epilepsy (TRPV1 is already a target in the peripheral nervous  system for pain relief).</p>

    <h2>10.0 Discovery and development of TRPV1 antagonists</h2>
    <p>Relief from chronic pain remains a recognized unmet medical need.  Consequently, the search for new analgesic agents is being intensively studied  by the pharmaceutical industry. The TRPV1 receptor is an ion channel that has  been implicated in mediation of many types of pain and therefore studied most  extensively. The first competitive antagonist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsazepine" title="Capsazepine">capsazepine</a>,  was first described in 1990, since then development of novel TRPV1 antagonists  has come a long way. This effort has led to the identification of several TRPV1  antagonists that have entered clinical trials as analgesic agents. Should these  new chemical entities relieve symptoms of chronic pain then this class of  compounds may offer one of the first novel mechanisms for the treatment of  pain, in many years. </p>
    
    <p>10.1 History</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">Capsaicin</a>,  the active ingredient in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilli_pepper" title="Chilli pepper">chilli  pepper</a> was first isolated over a century ago. In 1919 the exact  chemical structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> was determined and the complete synthesis of  the compound was achieved a decade later. Capsaicin has been used as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic" title="Analgesic">analgesic</a> for  decades, but the therapeutic potential of capsaicin was first recognized as  early as 1850. The effects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungent" title="Pungent">pungent</a> chemical,  capsaicin, is mediated through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_gated_ion_channel" title="Ligand gated ion channel">ligand gated ion channel</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a>. This  knowledge set the stage for further research of the function of the TRPV1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)" title="Receptor (biochemistry)">receptor</a> and preclinical studies  showed evidence of its importance in numerous human diseases. These  are the first agents acting by this mechanism that made their way into clinic  for evaluation of their use as possible analgesics and therefore important  targets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development" title="Drug development">drug development</a>. Many discoveries are yet to be  made, both in terms of the range of potential therapeutic applications in  addition to analgesia for TRPV1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" title="Receptor antagonist">antagonists</a> and it was only in the last  decade where there has been a full understanding of the molecular mechanism. In  the years to come it will be clearer if TRPV1 antagonists can fulfill their  potential.</p>
    
    <h3>10.2 Vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1/TRPV1 receptor)</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilloid_receptor" title="Vanilloid receptor">vanilloid receptor</a> (TRPV1) is one of six  sub-members that belong to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel" title="Transient receptor potential channel">transient receptor potential  channel</a> (TRP) superfamily. TRPV1 was the first mammalian member to be  discovered and is a non-selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation_channel" title="Cation channel">cation  channel</a> permeable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a>. The  receptor is made of four identical subunits each with six transmembrane  segments, S1-S6, and between fifth and sixth segment is an aqueous pore. This  region forms the channel conductive pore and contains the N- and C-termini on  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosolic" title="Cytosolic">cytosolic</a> side  of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane" title="Cell membrane">cell membrane</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">Capsaicin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resiniferatoxin" title="Resiniferatoxin">RTX</a>,  elicit burning pain by activating a non-selective cation channel expressed on  sensory nerve endings. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> was  found to have analgesic effects in preclinical studies much emphasis was put  into the research of the receptor/channel that capsaicin binds to and  activates. Besides being activated by capsaicin, TRPV1 also responds to a  wide range of exogenous and endogenous chemical ligands as well as physical  stimuli such as heat over 42 °C and changes in more diverse activators  such as protons (acid, pH&lt;6). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a> is also  subject to regulation by changes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential" title="Membrane potential">membrane potential</a> and this intrinsic  voltage-dependence is thought to underlie the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gating_(electrophysiology)" title="Gating (electrophysiology)">gating</a> mechanism of this  non-selective cation channel which leads to the influx of sodium and calcium  ions. Importantly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a> activity is also subject to regulation by a host of  intracellular signaling cascades such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-protein" title="G-protein">G-protein</a> coupled  receptor signaling, that are implicated in the responses to algogenic agents,  inflammatory mediators and injury.</p>
    
    <h3>10.3 Mechanism of action</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1" title="TRPV1">TRPV1</a> is  primarily expressed on, small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelinated" title="Myelinated">myelinated</a> and  unmyelinated medium size, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_neurons" title="Sensory neurons">sensory  neurons</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root" title="Dorsal root">dorsal root</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_ganglia" title="Trigeminal ganglia">trigeminal ganglia</a>, where sensory neurons  cluster. TRPV1 receptors are also found in muscles, joints, the urinary bladder  and kidneys. The functional activity of TRPV1 has been demonstrated, within the  central nervous system, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord" title="Spinal cord">spinal  cord</a> and specific sites in the brain including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" title="Hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum" title="Cerebellum">cerebellum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus" title="Locus coeruleus">locus  coeruleus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periaqueductal_grey" title="Periaqueductal grey">periaqueductal grey</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex" title="Cerebral cortex">cortex</a>.  Activation of TRPV1 sets off an influx of calcium and sodium ions which in turn  initiates a cascade of events that result in membrane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization" title="Depolarization">depolarization</a>,  neuronal firing and transduction of neural impulses. TRPV1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylates" title="Phosphorylates">phosphorylates</a> as  a response to several algesic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug" title="Pharmaceutical drug">agents</a>, resulting in a lower threshold of  channel activation. Some substances such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinin" title="Bradykinin">bradykinin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor" title="Nerve growth factor">nerve growth factor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons" title="Protons">protons</a> have  been reported to sensitize the TRPV1 receptor. Activation of TRPV1 results in  the release of pro-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptive" title="Nociceptive">nociceptive</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptides" title="Peptides">peptides</a>,  which decreases when treated with TRPV1 antagonists. In general, most channel  antagonists bind in the pore region, interacting with residues from all  four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomers" title="Monomers">monomers</a> of  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrameric" title="Tetrameric">tetrameric</a> channel.</p>
    
    <h3>10.4 Binding</h3>
    <p>Ligands of the TRPV1 receptor seem to act from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular" title="Intracellular">intracellular</a> side.  This is an unusual property of TRPV1, where ligands of most other ligand-gated  channels bind from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular" title="Extracellular">extracellular</a> space.  Capsaicin is highly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophilic" title="Lipophilic">lipophilic</a>and can pass the plasma membrane easily. It is  generally accepted that capsaicin acts on and binds to the TRPV1 receptor from  the intracellular side prior to activation. The critical sites for capsaicin  binding are Arg 114 and Glu 761 at the N- and C-termini of the receptor,  respectively. Because these two amino acids are charged and located in the  cytosolic part of TRPV1 receptor, the two regions are likely to be implicated  in hydrophilic interaction of TRPV1 with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilloids" title="Vanilloids">vanilloids</a> such  as capsaicin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resiniferatoxin" title="Resiniferatoxin">RTX</a>. In addition to these sites in N- and C-termini  of TRPV1, a region in the intracellular linker sited in the transmembrane  domain, called &lsquo;the TM3 region&rsquo;, has been shown to be critical for hydrophobic  interaction with vanilloids. The TM3 region is considered to be necessary for  binding to vanilloids. It is surrounded by the hydrophobic environment because  of its placement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_membrane" title="Plasma membrane">plasma  membrane</a>. Now it is recognized as an important link in hydrophobic  interaction with capsaicin. The binding sites Arg 114 and Glu 761 and the TM3  region in TRPV1, together consist of a binding pocket to vanilloids.</p>
    
    <h3>10.5 Agonists</h3>
    <p>Capsaicin (fig. 2), a naturally occurring vanilloid, is the best known  TRPV1 agonist. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resiniferatoxin" title="Resiniferatoxin">Resiniferatoxin</a> (RTX) is another naturally  occurring vanilloid that exhibits TRPV1 agonistic activity. It is more potent  than capsaicin and is currently in development as a sensory neuron  desensitizing agent. Initially, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonists" title="Agonists">agonists</a> were  the major focus of the TRPV1 ligand development due to the analgesic effect  resulting from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_(medicine)" title="Desensitization (medicine)">desensitization</a> of the receptor.  However, because of an initial burning effect of all natural vanilloid receptor  agonists, including capsaicin, therapy becomes complicated and perhaps  ineffective. Attempts to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis" title="Chemical synthesis">synthetic</a> agonists with good separation  between excitatory effects and the analgesic effects have not been successful.  To avoid this persisting side effects of TRPV1 agonists, a focused  consideration has been given to competitive antagonists as novel analgesic  drugs.</p>
    
    <h3>10.6 Antagonists</h3>
    <p>Intense efforts have been carried out to design both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive" title="Competitive">competitive</a> and  non-competitive TRPV1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" title="Receptor antagonist">antagonists</a>. Antagonists that bind to the  agonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site" title="Binding site">binding site</a>, and lock the channel in the closed,  nonconductive state are competitive antagonists. In contrast, antagonists that  interact with additional binding sites on the receptor structure preventing  receptor opening by the agonist or blocking its aqueous pore are  non-competitive antagonists. Non-competitive antagonists acting as open channel  blockers are therapeutically attractive because of their recognition of  over-activated TRPV1 channels, which can reduce the potential of unwanted side  effects.</p>
    
    <h3>10.7 Pharmacophore</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacophore" title="Pharmacophore">pharmacophore</a> model for TRPV1 antagonists consists  of three essential features: a hydrogen-bond acceptor, a hydrogen-bond donor,  and a ring feature. In addition, the TRPV1 antagonists have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superimposed" title="Superimposed">superimposed</a> in  such a way that they could ﬁt in the volume of the TRPV1 pore. When the  homology model is considered, appropriate interaction sites are found in the  receptor pore. The hydrogen-bond acceptor on the ligand is proposed to interact  with Tyr 667 (helix S6) on the receptor as a hydrogen-bond donor, and the  hydrogen-bond donor on the ligand is proposed to interact with Tyr 667 on the  opposite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer" title="Monomer">monomer</a> of  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetramer" title="Tetramer">tetramer</a> on  the receptor as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. The ring feature of the pharmacophore  is proposed to ﬁt in the hydrophobic space formed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_rings" title="Aromatic rings">aromatic  rings</a> of the four Tyr 667 residues of the four monomers. Consistent  with the critical role played by Tyr 667 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_interaction" title="Chemical interaction">interaction</a> with key elements of the  TPRV1 antagonist pharmacophore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-directed_mutagenesis" title="Site-directed mutagenesis">site-directed mutagenesis</a> studies  have shown that exchanging this tyrosine for alanine in the rat TRPV1 receptor  abolishes functional activity of TRPV1. The lipophilic end in antagonist is  varied in character and volume and interacts with the lower end of  transmembrane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helices" title="Helices">helices</a> S5 and S6. Because the intracellular ends of  these helices extend past the membrane, they are likely to be ﬂexible and may  be part of the channel opening and closing process. The combined use of a  pharmacophore model, assembled from highly optimized TRPV1 antagonists, with a  homology model of the protein has enhanced understanding of the observed  structure–activity relationships of many series of current TRPV1 antagonists,  and should be useful in the discovery of new classes of antagonists.</p>
    
    <h3>10.8 Structure activity relationship</h3>
    <p>Capsaicin (fig. 2) has three functional regions: an aromatic A region where  a parent homovanillyl (3-methoxy 4-hydroxybenzyl) group is optimal, a B region  known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">ester</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide" title="Amide">amide</a> linker  and the aliphatic C region where a lipophilic octanyl moiety is associated with  the highest potency. The homovanillyl motif and amide bond regions contain  dipolar groups which are implicated in hydrogen bonding interactions. Phenolic  hydroxide and amide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moiety_(chemistry)" title="Moiety (chemistry)">moieties</a> appear to be vital for inducing  capsaicin responses. Removal of the phenolic hydroxide or amide bond in capsaicin  analogues leads to reduction of potency. The phenolic hydroxide and amide  moieties in capsaicin share potential multiple hydrogen bond interactions with  the TRPV1 receptor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicinoids" title="Capsaicinoids">Capsaicinoids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsinoids" title="Capsinoids">capsinoids</a> are  characterized by an oxygenated aromatic moiety bound via an  amide(capsaicinoids) or ester (capsinoids) linker to a lipophilic acyl group.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanillyl" title="Vanillyl">vanillyl</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl" title="Carbonyl">carbonyl</a> linker  contain polar groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds essential for activity,  whereas the lipophilic moiety interacts with a corresponding cleft of the  vanilloid binding site on TRPV1. Replacement of the medium-sized branched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid" title="Fatty acid">fatty acid</a> of  capsaicin with longer fatty acids is damaging for activity, but the  presence of unsaturations restores and potentiates activity e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oleoylvanillamine&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Oleoylvanillamine (page does not exist)">oleoylvanillamine</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Olvanil&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Olvanil (page does not exist)">olvanil</a>)(fig. 3a), is 10-fold more  potent than capsaicin in TRPV1 activation assays.</p>
    
    <h4>10.8.1 1,3-Di(arylalkyl)thioureas</h4>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsazepine" title="Capsazepine">Capsazepine</a> (fig.  4a), the first competitive vanilloid antagonist, reported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis" title="Novartis">Novartis</a> group,  was aimed at assessing the effect of conformational constraint on the  lipophilic C-region of capsaicin. In capsazepine the amide bond of the  capsaicin is replaced by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiourea" title="Thiourea">thiourea</a> moiety and a propylidene linker between the  aromatic vanillyl 2-carbon A ring and the B-linker amide nitrogen forces the  aromatic ring in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal" title="Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> orientation with respect to the thiourea  bond. This constraint has long been considered as the distinctive  characteristic of vanilloid antagonism. Capsazepine competes for the  capsaicin-binding site on TRPV1 however, due to low metabolic stability and  poor pharmacokinetic properties the compound did not reach into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_development" title="Clinical development">clinical development</a>. It was observed  later on that this tether was not critical for activity as powerful antagonists  free from this structural feature were developed, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1,3-di(arylalkyl)thioureas&action=edit&redlink=1" title="1,3-di(arylalkyl)thioureas (page does not exist)">1,3-di(arylalkyl)thioureas</a> emerging  as one of the most promising non-vanilloid class of TRPV1 antagonist showing  excellent therapeutical potential in pain regulation. Within these compounds,  the replacement of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaiacyl" title="Guaiacyl">guaiacyl</a> moiety of capsaicinoids with a  3-fluoro-4-sulfonylamido group found critical to revert activity. This led to  the design of C-region moiety mimicked on RTX, led to compound seen in figure  4b,that showed excellent analgesic activity in mice. An alternative  optimization of the lipophilic C region led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=JYL1421&action=edit&redlink=1" title="JYL1421 (page does not exist)">JYL1421</a> (fig. 4c), another  promising clinical candidate.</p>
    
    <h4>10.8.2 Di(arylalkyl)- and aryl(arylakyl)ureas</h4>
    <p>Several capsaicin analogs of the urea type were developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acylation" title="Acylation">acylation</a> of  homovanillylamine and related amines with different  4-(α-pyridyl)piperidine-1-acyl chlorides. The presence of a polar amino moiety  in the hydrophobic C region of capsacinoids was crucial to couple potency  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophilicity" title="Hydrophilicity">hydrophilicity</a>, mimicking similar observations that  led to the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phenylacetylrinvanil&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Phenylacetylrinvanil (page does not exist)">phenylacetylrinvanil</a> (fig.  3b) from olvanil(fig. 3a). Phenylacetylrinvanil is the most potent capsaicinoid  reported to date, ~500-fold more potent than capsaicin. Several other  ureas emerged as remarkably active TRPV1 antagonists. Compared with  capsazepine, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piperazinyl_urea&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Piperazinyl urea (page does not exist)">piperazinyl urea</a> (fig.  5a and 5b) showed a higher selectivity profile against a wide variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzymes" title="Enzymes">enzymes</a> and  channels<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_TRPV1_antagonists#cite_note-Pomonis_2003-23">[23]</a> whereas  the related very potent and specific TRPV1 antagonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-425619&action=edit&redlink=1" title="A-425619 (page does not exist)">A-425619</a> (fig. 5c) could reduce  pain associated with inflammation and tissue injury in rats. Further  research has led to a variety of small-molecule antagonists of TRPV1, including  the ureas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SB-705498&action=edit&redlink=1" title="SB-705498 (page does not exist)">SB-705498</a> (fig. 5d), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SB-452533&action=edit&redlink=1" title="SB-452533 (page does not exist)">SB-452533</a> (fig. 5e) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ABT-102&action=edit&redlink=1" title="ABT-102 (page does not exist)">ABT-102</a>(fig. 5f), compounds that have  entered clinical trials.</p>
    
    <h4>10.8.5 Cinnamides</h4>
    <p>N-Arylcinnamides have emerged as potent and important  class of TRPV1 antagonists, Compound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SB-366791&action=edit&redlink=1" title="SB-366791 (page does not exist)">SB-366791</a>, (fig. 6a) shows  competitive and specific activity in both human and rat TRPV1 receptors overall  profile of receptor selectivity much better than that of capsazepine. Within  this series of compounds, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMG9810&action=edit&redlink=1" title="AMG9810 (page does not exist)">AMG9810</a> (fig. 6b) exhibited high  antagonist potency showing good oral bio-availability in rats and a  promising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetic" title="Pharmacokinetic">pharmacokinetic</a> profile, boding well for  clinical efficacy. Another potent blocker from this group is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMG0347&action=edit&redlink=1" title="AMG0347 (page does not exist)">AMG0347</a>(fig. 6c)that was shown in a  postoperative pain trial to be able to decrease capsaicin-induced heat and  mechanical hyperalgesia and to block central TRPV1 receptors.</p>
    
    <h4>10.8.6 Carboxamides</h4>
    <p>Several TRPV1 antagonists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxamide" title="Carboxamide">carboxamide</a> type  have been discovered. They are structurally quite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogenous" title="Heterogenous">heterogenous</a>,  as exemplified by comparison of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide" title="Nicotinamide">nicotinamide</a> derivative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SB-782443&action=edit&redlink=1" title="SB-782443 (page does not exist)">SB-782443</a> (fig. 7a), the  thiazolylcarboxamide (fig. 7b), and the tetrahydropyridylcarboxamide (fig. 7c). SB-782443  (fig. 7a) showed excellent potency at human, guinea pig, and rat TRPV1, a  favorable <em>in vitro</em> drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics  profile, and remarkable <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo" title="In vivo">in vivo</a></em> activity  in an inflammatory pain model. Based on their <em>in vitro</em> profile,  several compounds of this class qualified for preclinical development.</p>
    <p><strong>Other derivatives</strong>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discovery_and_development_of_TRPV1_antagonists&action=edit&section=14" title="Edit section: Other derivatives">edit</a>]</p>
    
    <h4>10.8.7 Nonclassic antagonists</h4>
    <p>Nonclassic antagonists lack the urea, thiourea, or amide  groups typical of the classic TRPV1 ligands. Two major structural types of  nonclassic antagonists have been discovered. First there are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazole" title="Imidazole">imidazole</a> derivatives.  Starting from a 4,6-disubstituted benzimidazole lead structure, a series of  4,5-biarylimidazoles capable to block both capsaicin and acid-induced calcium  influx in TRPV1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazole" title="Imidazole">Imidazole</a> (fig.  8a) was identified as a highly potent and orally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailable" title="Bioavailable">bioavailable</a> TRPV1. Another  class are the diaryl ethers and amines. Compounds from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinazoline" title="Quinazoline">quinazoline</a> series  can be considered as conformationally restricted analogs of a biarylamide  series. In terms of activity 5-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoquinoline" title="Isoquinoline">isoquinoline</a> was  found the most active among and ranked in the order of 5-isoquinoline &gt; 8-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoline" title="Quinoline">quinoline</a> &gt;  8-quinazoline &gt; 8-isoquinoline ≥ cinnoline &gt; phthalazine &gt; quinoxaline  &gt; 5-quinoline e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMG517&action=edit&redlink=1" title="AMG517 (page does not exist)">AMG517</a> (fig. 8b),although it  lacks any recognizable carbonyl motif it still potently blocks capsaicin,  proton, and heat activation of TRPV1 <em>in vitro</em> and shows a good  tolerability profile. Also, the clinical candidates from Janssen, Abott  and Merck pharmaceuticals (fig. 8c) having a 5-aminoisoquinoline group as a  common feature suggesting that there is a key interaction of this group at the  receptor site for TRPV1 antagonist activity.</p>
    
    <h4>10.8.9 Current status</h4>
    <p>In November 2009, the FDA approved Qutenza (capsaicin, 8% topical patch)  for postherpetic neuralgia. As of late 2009, available public information suggests that quite a few are  in clinical trials. Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are  developing TRPV1 ligands and the emphasis seems to be on both agonists and  antagonists. Although the agonists appear to be further along in clinical  development.</p>
    
    <h5>10.8.9.1 Agonists</h5>
    <p>NeurogesX has successfully completed three Phase III clinical studies of  Qutenza (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NGX-4010&action=edit&redlink=1" title="NGX-4010 (page does not exist)">NGX-4010</a>) that met studies primary  endpoints. Qutenza is a synthetic trans-capsaicin and drug delivery is by a  rapid-delivery patch application system NeurogesX plans to launch Qutenza  in the United States in the first half of November 2010. Anesiva, another  biotechnology company, has completed two Phase III trials of Adlea (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ALGRX_4975&action=edit&redlink=1" title="ALGRX 4975 (page does not exist)">ALGRX 4975</a>), an injectable  capsaicin. Adlea is promising as a pain reliever and both trials showed  that Adlea&rsquo;s safety profile of adverse events, wound healing, and wound sensory  function were similar to placebo over the study duration.</p>
    
    <h5>10.8.9.2 Antagonists</h5>
    <p>At least seven orally active TRPV1 antagonist substances have progressed  into clinical development and several more are in preclinical development. The  ligand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRC_6211&action=edit&redlink=1" title="GRC 6211 (page does not exist)">GRC 6211</a>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company" title="Eli Lilly and Company">Eli Lilly and Company</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenmark_Pharmaceuticals" title="Glenmark Pharmaceuticals">Glenmark</a> is the most advanced and is  currently in phase IIb clinical trials. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline" title="GlaxoSmithKline">GlaxoSmithKline</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co." title="Merck & Co.">Merck</a>-Neurogen, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amgen" title="Amgen">Amgen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" title="AstraZeneca">AstraZeneca</a> are  all developing TRPV1 antagonist and all are developing substances that have  completed phase I trials successfully.</p>
